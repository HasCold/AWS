------------------------------ AWS CLI -----------------------------------
If we have to access the aws services via command line so we have a tool called AWS CLI.

- FOR AWS CLI based access we have to get the token; 
Access Key and Private Key are the keys to access the data or bucket.

AWS CLI V2 guide 

- SSH Connect establish with EC2 instance.
- Install the unzip package in AWS ECS instance via the AWS CLI. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html


- In our system, we installed the AWS CLI but that AWS CLI will interact which AWS account so for that we have to confiure the the credential 

e.g. :- 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-4-87:~$ aws s3 ls
Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws login".

ubuntu@ip-172-31-4-87:~$ aws configure
AWS Acc Key ID [None]:  
AWS Sec Access Key [None]:  
Default region name [None]:
Default output format [None]:

- Now If I have to access one of the aws service like S3 and want to list down the buckets name so can be able to done this now;
ubuntu@ip-172-31-4-87:~$ aws s3 ls
