---------------------- Main Components -----------------
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) - Security for checking the incoming request are from users or bots.

- Load Balancer(Elastic Load Balancer) - If u select "internet facing" option instead of "internal" in the Policy Tracking section while in the process of Auto-Scaling Group so this will give you the public-facing-url. e.g. This is a DNS name :- aws-learning-session-alb-1148912274.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com  

- Target Group : 80 default port which means request comes to this by load balancer will distribute further requests  

- Auto Scaling Group

------------------------ Load Balancers ----------------------
- There are two type of load balancer
1. Application Load Balancer
1. Network Load Balancer

- OSI Model
1. Application Load Balancer staged on to the 7 layer of the OSI (Applicaion Layer). -->> HTTPS/HTTP

2. Network Load Balancer staged on to the 4 layer of the OSI (Network Layer). --->> TCP,UDP,TLS

-------------------- AWS Load Balancer Concept --------------------------

Remember :- 

1. Minimum Size :- The minimum requirement that we need when there is no traffic.

2. Desired Capacity :- The normal application is running so then how much instances are always running that is desired.

3. Maximum Size :- When there is an spike in the traffic so how much instance can scale upto the size.
