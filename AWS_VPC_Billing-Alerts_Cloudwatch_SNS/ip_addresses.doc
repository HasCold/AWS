## First: what is an IP address?

An **IP address** is like a **home address for a device on the internet**.

* Your laptop, mobile, server, router → all need an IP
* It helps data know **where to go and where it came from**

📦 *No IP address = no internet communication*

---

## What is IPv4?

**IPv4 = Internet Protocol version 4**

It’s the **older and most common** type of IP address.

### Example:

```
192.168.1.1
8.8.8.8
172.16.0.5
```

### How it looks:

* 4 numbers
* Each number: 0–255
* Written with dots (`.`)

### Problem with IPv4 ❌

IPv4 can only create about **4.3 billion addresses**.

➡️ With phones, laptops, servers, IoT devices, cloud…
**We ran out of IPv4 addresses**.

That’s the main reason IPv6 exists.

---

## What is IPv6?

**IPv6 = Internet Protocol version 6**

It’s the **newer version** designed to fix the IPv4 shortage.

### Example:

```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

### How it looks:

* Uses **hexadecimal** (0–9, a–f)
* Written with colons (`:`)
* Much longer than IPv4

### Big advantage of IPv6 ✅

IPv6 can create:

> **340 undecillion addresses**
> (that’s more than enough for every device on Earth… and more)

## Simple comparison

| Feature       | IPv4              | IPv6               |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Version       | Old               | New                |
| Address size  | 32-bit            | 128-bit            |
| Example       | `8.8.8.8`         | `2001:db8::1`      |
| Address count | ~4 billion        | Almost unlimited   |
| Still used?   | Yes (very common) | Yes (growing fast) |

## Real-life analogy 🏠

* **IPv4** → Like **old phone numbers** with limited digits
* **IPv6** → Like **modern phone numbers** with country codes and extra digits

More digits = more unique numbers.

---

## Why do we still use IPv4?

Good question 👇

* Old systems still depend on IPv4
* IPv6 migration takes time
* Tools like **NAT (Network Address Translation)** help reuse IPv4 addresses

So today, the internet runs in a **dual-stack** mode:

> **IPv4 + IPv6 together**

---

## In cloud & DevOps (important for you)

Since you work with **AWS / backend / networking**:

* EC2, Load Balancers, Kubernetes → support both IPv4 & IPv6
* AWS often gives:

  * **Public IPv4** (sometimes paid)
  * **Free IPv6**
* Modern systems prefer IPv6, but **IPv4 is still unavoidable**

Real-life analogy 🏢

Imagine an office building:

Private IP → extension number inside the office
Public IP → main office phone number

Employees call each other using extensions
External people call the main number
